#write a program to take 2 numbers from the user,
#then take option to add/subtract/mutiple/divide
#and perform that operation
a=int(input("value of a:"))
b=int(input("value of b:"))
c=a+b
print("addition of a and b:",c)
d=a-b
print("substaction of a and b:",d)
e=a*b
print("multiplication of a and b:",e)
f=a/b
print("division of a and b:",f)

OUTPUT
value of a:6
value of b:8
addition of a and b: 14
substaction of a and b: -2
multiplication of a and b: 48
division of a and b: 0.75
